Class an Struct

•	A class or struct defines the template for an object
•	A class represent a reference type
•	A struct represent a value type

Struct
•	Struct  with the same name are not related in memory, 
•	Structs cannot be inherited. 
•	Structs are passed by value and not by reference.
•	Structs are stored on the stack not the heap. 
•	The result is better performance with Structs.

Class
•	Two things a class can do, which is hold data in a property, do something and raise an event.
•	Static – cannot instantiated 
•	Abstract – incomplete, must be completed by a class that inherit it
o	Two files that implement the same class, with different logic
o	
•	Sealed – cannot be inherited



	Method has a parameter
	Parameter has an argument


Methods and Events

Event
•	Needs a handler
•	Event is a way for a class or an object to talk back to me
•	Happens after something has happened
•	Event name is called like you would call a method
•	To listen to that event, you need to subscribe to that event
Boxing/ Unboxing

Boxing 
•	Act of converting a value type into a reference type
•	Computationally expensive – avoid repetition

Unboxing
•	Act of converting a reference type into a value type
•	Requires a CAST
